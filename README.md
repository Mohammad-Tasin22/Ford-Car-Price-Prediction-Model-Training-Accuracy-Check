# Ford-Car-Price-Prediction-Model-Training-Accuracy-Check
This project is about training a machine learning model to predict Ford car prices using a Kaggle dataset.
I focused on data preprocessing, encoding, model training, and accuracy checking. Final price prediction was not done yet.

What this project includes:

  1. Dataset: Ford Car Price data from Kaggle
  2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
  3. Used Label Encoding for ordinal/single-value columns
  4. Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical features with multiple categories
  5. Trained machine learning model(s)
  6. Checked and compared model accuracy

This project is great for beginners who want to learn how to prepare data, use encoding techniques, and train ML models on a real-world dataset.
